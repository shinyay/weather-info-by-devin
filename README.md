# Weather Information Web Application

This project is a user-friendly web application designed to display weather information, with a focus on rain cloud data. The application allows users to view weather data from the past five hours using a slider feature.

## Features

- Display current weather information, including temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover.
- Slider feature to view weather data from the past five hours.
- User-friendly interface designed with Chakra UI.
- Integration with Open-Meteo API for weather data.
- Future integration with RainViewer's Weather Maps API for detailed rain cloud visualization.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devin-ai-integration/weather-info-by-devin.git
   cd weather-info-by-devin
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Netlify. You can access the live application at the following URL:
[http://dreamy-haupia-22fb84.netlify.app](http://dreamy-haupia-22fb84.netlify.app)

## Usage

- Open the application in your browser.
- Use the slider to view weather data from the past five hours.
- The weather information, including temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover, will be displayed for the selected time.

## Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for the Open-Meteo API integration.

## Future Plans

- Integrate RainViewer's Weather Maps API for detailed rain cloud visualization.
- Add more weather data sources and features as needed.
